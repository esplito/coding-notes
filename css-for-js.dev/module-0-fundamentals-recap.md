### Anatomy of a style rule

A **property** is an attribute that you can specify a value for, such as "font-size" or "color".

The **selector** can be described as a descriptor that lets you target specific elements on a page. Example: `.my-class` would target all nodes with the class `my-class` class.

A **declaration** is a combination of a property and a value, such as `color: #fff;`.

A **rule** (also knowis a collection of declarations, which targets one or more selectors. A stylesheet is made of multiple rules.

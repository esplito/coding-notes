## Advanced React Patterns

### Context Module Functions

This is overkill, but it can in some situations help you reduce duplication, improve performance and help you avoid mistakes in the dependency lists.

>ðŸ¦‰ Tip: You may notice that the context provider/consumers in React DevTools just display as `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer`. That doesnâ€™t do a good job differentiating itself from other contexts that may be in your app. Luckily, you can set the context `displayName` and itâ€™ll display that name for the `Provider` and `Consumer`. Hopefully in the future this will happen automatically ([learn more](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11241)).

**Why do we even use this pattern?**
Dodds:
> We pretty much just moved something into another function. Why is this even a pattern?

> **The benefit** of this pattern is that **we can take all of this stuff and put it into a separate function**, and then pass the things that are required. Each one of these is going to require the dispatch function.
> 
> **The benefit** of doing things this way is that **when we have multiple dispatches** that we're going to be calling, if we just leave that up to the user of our context, it's very **possible that they might miss a dispatch call**. It's better to pass that user dispatch to this context module function, so it can ensure that we're calling the dispatch in the right order.

### Compound Components

Think of it like how `<select>` and `option` works. They're useless by themselves, but great together. That's how Compound Components works.

>The `<select>` is the element responsible for managing the state of the UI, and the `<option>` elements are essentially more configuration for how the select should operate (specifically, which options are available and their values).

This pattern is used in [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) and @reach/tooltip.

Used in this exercise: 
- [React.cloneElement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement)
- [React.Children.map](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildren)

> You can think of React.Children.map as basically an array.map, except it works especially for React.Children because the children prop can be a single element, or it can be an array of elements.

The exercise shows how you share implicit state for compound components.

You can restrict which type of children you want to allow in your compound component by specifying allowed types and then only use `React.cloneElement()` on those:

```js
const allowedTypes = [ToggleOn, ToggleOff, ToggleButton];

return  React.Children.map(children, child  => {
  if(allowedTypes.includes(child.type)){
    return  React.cloneElement(child, {on, toggle})
    // the props 'on' and 'toggle' will only be available
    // to children that are ToggleOn, ToggleOf or ToggleButton
  }
  return  child;
})
```

### Flexible Compound Components

The compound component that we created in the previous exercise doesn't w

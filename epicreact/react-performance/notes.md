## React Performance

### Welcome

> There are a couple of examples that will be useful to you in here, to get an idea of how a different files work together, when we're doing lazy loading or code splitting, lazy loading of this code. You'll be playing around in there a little bit, but most of your time will be spent in these exercises.
> 
> Actually, lots of these exercises don't require a lot of code changes. What you'll actually be doing is spending a lot of your time in the Network tab, the Profiler, and the Performance tab. You may or may not be very familiar with these tools and that's totally fine. - Dodds

### Code Splitting


> 🦉 One great way to analyze your app to determine the need/benefit of code splitting for a certain feature/page/interaction, is to use [the “Coverage” feature of the developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage).

### Concurrent Mode

> I use ReactDOM.render. To use React Concurrent Mode, though, I need to use the new ReactDOM.createRoot API. This createRoot API accepts our root element. - Dodds
> 
> This implies that you can only enable Concurrent Mode for the entire application starting at the root element where you're mounting your initial UI. You cannot opt into Concurrent Mode in different components through your application. - Dodds

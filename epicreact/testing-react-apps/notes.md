## Testing React Apps

### Intro
> Remember testing is 100 percent about how can you be confident that you can ship things. Another tip, when you're looking at a component that you want to test, step back for a second and think, "If I were a manual tester, how would I test this?" Then make your test do the thing that the manual tester would do. - Dodds

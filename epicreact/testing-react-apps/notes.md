## Testing React Apps

### Intro
> Remember testing is 100 percent about how can you be confident that you can ship things. Another tip, when you're looking at a component that you want to test, step back for a second and think, "If I were a manual tester, how would I test this?" Then make your test do the thing that the manual tester would do. - Dodds

> So, what's a JavaScript test? It's simply some code which sets up some state, performs some action, and makes an assertion on the new state. - [But really, what is a Javascript test? - Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-test)

### Simple Test with ReactDOM

When we think about how an application is used, we have to consider who the users are.

Users:
1. The end users -> the ones who interact with our application (by clicking buttons etc.)
2. The developer users -> the ones who uses our code (rendering it, calling our functions etc.)

We want to avoid a third user creeping into our tests. More on this here: [Avoid the test user](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user)

> When it comes to React components, our developer user will render our component with `ReactDOM` (similar concept for React Native) and in some cases they'll pass props and/or wrap it in a context provider. The end user will click buttons and assert on the output.

**Extra credit 1: use dispatchEvent**
In the extra credit we use `MouseEvent` and `dispatchEvent`. Resources on these can be found here:
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent

It's important to clean up the DOM between each test. To do this we could write something like this:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
	document.body.innerHTML = '';
})
```

Note: If we use React Testing Library we would get lots of functionality without having to write them ourselves (like cleanup and click events etc.)

### Simple test with React Testing Library

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react) removes the need for us to write boilerplate code that is not so relevant to us as developers (like wrapping stuff in the `act`-function and  writing cleanup-functions).

> As we're rendering, this React Testing Library will keep track of all the divs. As we're rendering, this React Testing Library will actually keep track of all the divs that it's creating. It will remove those divs from the document.body, as well as unmount the components that were rendered. - Dodds

To get more assertions that you can use in your tests you can import Testing LibraryÂ´s own suite of assertions for jest: [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](http://testing-library.com/jest-dom).


### Avoid Implementation Details

> One of the most important things to remember about testing our software the way it is used is to avoid testing implementation details. "Implementation details" is a term referring to how an abstraction accomplishes a certain outcome. Thanks to the expressiveness of code, you can typically accomplish the same outcome using completely different implementation details. - Dodds

> The implementation of your abstractions does not matter to the users of your abstraction and if you want to have confidence that it continues to work through refactors then **neither should your tests.** - Dodds

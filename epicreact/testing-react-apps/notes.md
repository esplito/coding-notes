## Testing React Apps

### Intro
> Remember testing is 100 percent about how can you be confident that you can ship things. Another tip, when you're looking at a component that you want to test, step back for a second and think, "If I were a manual tester, how would I test this?" Then make your test do the thing that the manual tester would do. - Dodds

> So, what's a JavaScript test? It's simply some code which sets up some state, performs some action, and makes an assertion on the new state. - [But really, what is a Javascript test? - Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-test)

### Simple Test with ReactDOM

When we think about how an application is used, we have to consider who the users are.

Users:
1. The end users -> the ones who interact with our application (by clicking buttons etc.)
2. The developer users -> the ones who uses our code (rendering it, calling our functions etc.)

We want to avoid a third user creeping into our tests. More on this here: [Avoid the test user](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user)

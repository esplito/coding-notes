# Recommended process for exercises

This is from Kent's "Example Runthrough".

1. First run "Intro" video
2. Read through all of the information in the exercise and read the documentation that is mentioned.
3. Then open the exercise on an isolated page, next to your editor.
4. Switch the test from final to your exercise.
5. Run npm t
6. Open up the exercise-file in VS Code.
7. Have the DevTools opened in your browser.
8. Before you watch the solution, work through the exercise.

**Read all the notes!**

* Extra credits have less "hand-holding". 
* There's DevTools built-in that you can use to simulate stuff when doing api-requests.  Just press the tool-icon in the bottom left.
* Each workshop takes around 4 hours when Kent does them live, so make sure that you take breaks.
	* Recommended: Do one exercise, then take a break.

# Running tests
You can run `npm test`, `npm t` or `npm run test` to run jest in watch mode. This will then show you some options to run a specific test with pattern matching.  You choose the file you want to test with the p-key on your keyboard.

You need to disable the import of "final" and uncomment import of "exercise" in the tests if you want to run tests on your exercises.

Note: You can't test the html-files.

# Running tests
You can run `npm test`, `npm t` or `npm run test` to run jest in watch mode. This will then show you some options to run a specific test with pattern matching. 

You need to disable the import of "final" and uncomment import of "exercise" in the tests if you want to run tests on your exercises.

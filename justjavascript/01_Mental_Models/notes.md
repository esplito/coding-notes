### What's a Mental Model?

>For example, many people first learned about variables as “boxes”—containers that hold your stuff. Even if you don’t vividly imagine boxes anymore when you see a variable, they might still behave “boxily” in your imagination.
>
>These approximations of how something works in your head are known as “mental models.” It may be hard if you’ve been programming for a long time, but try to notice and introspect your mental models. They’re probably a combination of visual, spatial, and mechanical mental shortcuts. These intuitions (like “boxiness” of variables) influence how we read code our whole lives.
>
>Unfortunately, sometimes our mental models are wrong.

✅ The course will rebuild your mental model of Javascript to be accurate and useful. 

✅ Having a good mental model gives you **confidence in your own code** and it will let you **understand and fix someone else's code**.

### Coding Fast and Slow

📚 Book to read: "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

When we can we rely on the *fast* system:
1. Good at pattern matching 💫
2. Gut reactions 💫
3. Gives us the ability to walk without falling over 💫
4. **Not good** at planning 🚨

>Uniquely, thanks to the development of the frontal lobe, humans also possess a “slow” thinking system.

The *slow* thinking system is responsible for:
1. Complex step-by-step reasoning which lets us:
	2. Plan future events
	3. Engage in arguments
	4. Follow mathematical proofs

⚠ However, when doing intellectual tasks like coding, we tend to still default to the *fast* system, because the *slow* system is too mentally draining.

>These approximations of how something works in your head are known as “mental models.” It may be hard if you’ve been programming for a long time, but try to notice and introspect your mental models. They’re probably a combination of visual, spatial, and mechanical mental shortcuts. These intuitions (like “boxiness” of variables) influence how we read code our whole lives.

>Unfortunately, sometimes our mental models are wrong.

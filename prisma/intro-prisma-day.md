## Lesson 1 - Notes

Run this command to generate migration files for your db.

`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`

Run this command to get prisma studio running:
`npx prisma studio`

You can use the [JSON Schema Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-json-schema-generator) if you want to generate JSON from your Prisma Models. There's also a community module for generating Typescript Types.

You can use `uuid` and `cuid` for ids in your model.

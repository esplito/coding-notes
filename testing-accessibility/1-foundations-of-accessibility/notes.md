# Setting the Stage for Accessibility

## Lesson 1 - What is Digital Accessibility?

ðŸ”– **Definition of digital accessibility (a11y)** ðŸ”–
> _Digital accessibility refers to the practice of preventing and removing barriers that keep disabled people from accessing, reading, or writing digital content and interacting with online features._

ðŸŽ¯ **The goal** ðŸŽ¯
----> _Eliminate barriers_ to access.
1. Catch issues early in the development phase 
2. Will probably need to talk to designers about things that can be problematic
3. If a11y issues are found, prioritize and remember for the next thing you build!

ðŸ’¡**Accessibility is...**ðŸ’¡
1. A civil right to participate in society
2. A key part of design:
> There are analogues between acccessibility in digital spaces and accessibility in the architectural features of public and private spaces ("the built environment"). Being an accessibility expert is like being an architect. We need to prioritize structural access that includes disability in design and user experience.
3. Often forgotten. ðŸ™ƒ

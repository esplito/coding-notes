# Setting the Stage for Accessibility

## Lesson 1 - What is Digital Accessibility?

🔖 **Definition of digital accessibility (a11y)** 🔖
> _Digital accessibility refers to the practice of preventing and removing barriers that keep disabled people from accessing, reading, or writing digital content and interacting with online features._

🎯 **The goal** 🎯
----> _Eliminate barriers_ to access.
1. Catch issues early in the development phase 
2. Will probably need to talk to designers about things that can be problematic
3. If a11y issues are found, prioritize and remember for the next thing you build!

💡**Accessibility is...**💡
1. A civil right to participate in society
2. A key part of design:
> There are analogues between acccessibility in digital spaces and accessibility in the architectural features of public and private spaces ("the built environment"). Being an accessibility expert is like being an architect. We need to prioritize structural access that includes disability in design and user experience.
3. Often forgotten. 🙃

🥁 **What can we do to _not_ make it forgotten?** 🥁

- Share info about its importance
- Keep beating the drum to get more people on board and excited about improving access.
- Prioritize from the beginning -> _Must_ be part of the requirements for the features we ship.
- Communicate its importance in your organization. 
- Find allies and colleagues who are positioned to advocate with you among your management and leadership teams.

>**If accessibility is marginalized, it creates a self-perpetuating culture of discrimination.**

No keyboard support or screen reader support? = 🚨 Exclusion 🚨.

Sometimes using words like _discrimination_ or _ableism_ can get people to pay more attention to accessibility.

> _Inaccessibility_ is discrimination in practice, whether intentional or not.

	- You otherwise might have to:
		- Share your private account information with someone to get your banking errands done (because of an inaccessible banking website).

### a11y for businesses
🚩**Common excuse** 🚩
"That's not our customer" -> Well, if the website isn't accessible , they can't be your customer.

🌟 **Benefits of prioritizing a11y** 🌟
1. More revenue from a whole new group of people.
2. If you hire individuals with disabilities
	- You get better feedback early in the design & development process and in turn avoid costly rework later
3. The business can highlight the a11y work they've done. By doing this in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) reports, it can stand out and gain more customers.
4. You can avoid costly lawsuits by being proactive.
5. Helps expand the business into government and educational sectors where accessibility is an 

**Other aspects**
✅ Including an accessibility statement and inviting feedback are great ways to continuously improve.

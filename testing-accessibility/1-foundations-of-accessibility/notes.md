## Lesson 1 - What is Digital Accessibility?

🔖 **Definition of digital accessibility (a11y)** 🔖
> _Digital accessibility refers to the practice of preventing and removing barriers that keep disabled people from accessing, reading, or writing digital content and interacting with online features._

🎯 **The goal** 🎯
----> _Eliminate barriers_ to access.
1. Catch issues early in the development phase 
2. Will probably need to talk to designers about things that can be problematic
3. If a11y issues are found, prioritize and remember for the next thing you build!

💡 **Accessibility is...** 💡
1. A civil right to participate in society
2. A key part of design:
> There are analogues between acccessibility in digital spaces and accessibility in the architectural features of public and private spaces ("the built environment"). Being an accessibility expert is like being an architect. We need to prioritize structural access that includes disability in design and user experience.
3. Often forgotten. 🙃

🥁 **What can we do to _not_ make it forgotten?** 🥁

- Share info about its importance
- Keep beating the drum to get more people on board and excited about improving access.
- Prioritize from the beginning -> _Must_ be part of the requirements for the features we ship.
- Communicate its importance in your organization. 
- Find allies and colleagues who are positioned to advocate with you among your management and leadership teams.

>**If accessibility is marginalized, it creates a self-perpetuating culture of discrimination.**

No keyboard support or screen reader support? = 🚨 Exclusion 🚨.

Sometimes using words like _discrimination_ or _ableism_ can get people to pay more attention to accessibility.

> _Inaccessibility_ is discrimination in practice, whether intentional or not. 

### a11y for individuals
- It's important for independence.
	- You otherwise might have to:
		- Share your private account information with someone to get your banking errands done (because of an inaccessible banking website).

### a11y for businesses
🚩**Common excuse** 🚩
"That's not our customer" -> Well, if the website isn't accessible , they can't be your customer.

🌟 **Benefits of prioritizing a11y** 🌟
1. More revenue from a whole new group of people.
2. If you hire individuals with disabilities
	- You get better feedback early in the design & development process and in turn avoid costly rework later
3. The business can highlight the a11y work they've done. By doing this in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) reports, it can stand out and gain more customers.
4. You can avoid costly lawsuits by being proactive.
5. Helps expand the business into government and educational sectors where accessibility is a legal requirement.
6. Being proactive gives you an opportunity to be innovative when building, instead of chasing compliance.

**Other aspects**
📈 Including an accessibility statement and inviting feedback are great ways to continuously improve.

### a11y for society

🌟 Can help reduce social isolation and improve mental health for people with disabilities.
🌟 Not being excluded and instead able to participate, creates opportunities.

> When accessibility is a priority, _everyone benefits_

Marcy's suggestion for more reading:
📖  "Development and implementation of a framework for estimating the economic benefits of an accessible and inclusive society." from the journal of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. 📖 

## Lesson 2 - Why is Accessibility important?

### Accessibility as a Moral Case
> Doing it because it's the necessary and right thing to do

No access = people with disabilities may not:
1. Access your site
2. Perform actions independently and securely
3. Participate in society in a digital world
4. Make valuable contributions in the workplace

 
**Do you feel like you are swimming upstream when pushing for accessibility as the right thing to do?** 😫   
Then it can be very helpful to appeal to the business case for accessibility. 📈

🏛 Marcy also refers to the [capitol crawl](https://www.history.com/news/americans-with-disabilities-act-1990-capitol-crawl) in 1990 where people demonstrated and crawled up the steps of the U.S Capitol in DC to show how people with disabilities are impacted by lack of physical access in public spaces. (this lead to the legislation, "Americans with Disabilities Act", ADA) 🏛

Similarly, if accessibility isn't prioritized within the digital space, then the impacts are echoed.

### Accessibility as a Business Case

The following stats are mentioned and they are mostly focused on the US, but also the whole world:
> - At least **one billion people** - 15% of the world's population, have a recognized disability.
> - People with disabilities & the people in their lives control **$8 trillion** in spending
> - The disposable income for working-age people with disabilities is **$645 billion**, and is comparable to other market segments like African Americans and Hispanic people.
> - There were **4055** ADA-related lawsuits filed against businesses in the United States in 2021 - 15% increase from 2020.

You can make use of these numbers if stakeholders are more likely to listen to 💰💸🤑

### Accessibility: The Legal Situation

There are different laws protecting digital civil rights, depending on where your team is located.

**USA 🇺🇸**
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)
- Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)
- Section 508

> Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act in the United States requires that any software created or procured by the government is accessible. - Marcy Sutton

⚠️ It is **currently not an ADA requirement** to follow the Web Accessibility Initiative's WCAG standards. ⚠️

**Canada 🇨🇦**
- Accessible Canada Act
- Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

**EU 🇪🇺**

- Web Accessibility Directive
	- Affects the public sector such as governments
- European Accessibility Act
	- **Will include the private sector.** → Implementation phase in member countries will run at least through **2025**. 

Marcy also recommends to follow Lainey Feingold for more about the legal situation of accessibility.

## Lesson 3 - Language & Definitions of Accessibility

Marcy highlights the importance of having a similar set of definitions for terms and acronyms that you encounter when working with accessibility. They fall into three categories:
1. Technologies ⌨️
2. Guidelines & Standards 📜
3. Miscellaneous 🧰

Don't assume that everyone knows what these terms mean.

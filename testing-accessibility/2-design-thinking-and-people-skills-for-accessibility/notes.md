## Lesson 1 - Intro & overview

**How do we get accessibility to be successful?**
By making it a _core part_ of the product design process and addressing it earlier than development.

**What will we learn in this module?**
- Accessibility in the **different parts of the software development life cycle** (SDLC) ♻
- How to **advocate and expand** accessibility **across more roles** than developers. 📢
- The ability to recognize what's at stake without digital access and **the impact it could have if we don't make things accessible**. 🛑
- How to **collaborate in the design phase** → to share feedback earlier so that it not just coded with accessibility in mind, but also designed with it in mind! 🎨
- The ability to **solve problems and validate ideas before implementing** them. ✅
- The mechanics of **building a culture of accessibility** across your team and organization. 🙏

**What will we learn in this module?**
- Accessibility in the different parts of the software development life cycle (SDLC)
- How to advocate and expand accessibility across more roles than developers.
- The ability to recognize what's at stake without digital access and the impact it could have if we don't make things accessible.
- How to collaborate in the design phase → to share feedback earlier

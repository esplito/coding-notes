## Section 1 - Intro & overview

**How do we get accessibility to be successful?**
By making it a _core part_ of the product design process and addressing it earlier than development.

**What will we learn in this module?**
- Accessibility in the **different parts of the software development life cycle** (SDLC) ♻
- How to **advocate and expand** accessibility **across more roles** than developers. 📢
- The ability to recognize what's at stake without digital access and **the impact it could have if we don't make things accessible**. 🛑
- How to **collaborate in the design phase** → to share feedback earlier so that it not just coded with accessibility in mind, but also designed with it in mind! 🎨
- The ability to **solve problems and validate ideas before implementing** them. ✅
- The mechanics of **building a culture of accessibility** across your team and organization. 🙏

### WCAG Overview
>An essential piece of the puzzle is WCAG. Getting to know [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v. 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) will be critical to working with accessibility on teams. - Marcy Sutton

When Marcy recorded the video, WCAG Version 2.2 was estimated to be out in September 2022 (it is now estimated to be out Dec. 2022).

Guideline categories:
- Perceivable 👀
- Operable 🕹
- Understandable 🤔
- Robust 💪

In the course we'll treat WCAG as a policy rather than a strict requirement.

**What will be covered?**
- How to decide which version to choose for your organization.
- How to find answers to accessibility questions (even WCAG feels vague/complex)
- WCAG Silver (complete rethink of WCAG)
- How to stay up to date with upcoming changes

## Section 2 - Accessibility as User Experience
> After this section, you will be able to **identify accessibility problems elsewhere in the organization** and figure out **how to persuade the stakeholders in power positions effectively**. - Marcy Sutton

### Lesson 1 - Accessibility Issues Outside the Development Phase
> In this lesson, we’ll talk about common “non-code” accessibility situations and approaches for solving them. - Marcy Sutton

## Section 1 - Intro & overview

### What will I get in this module?
- A repeatable accessibility testing process that can be applied to any web application. ♲
- Gain experience with different tools and learn their limitations and when to look beyond them

🚨 **Remember to think about how you would apply this to your own applications!** 🚨

This summarizes what this module is all about:
> 📝Exercise
>**You are a developer for CampSpots, whose product is a web app that will allow users to browse and reserve places to go out and camp.**
>Another member of the dev team has opened a Pull Request with an initial prototype build of the site. It is your responsibility to test the accessibility of the application. As you find issues with the application, share details about the issues along with how you would implement the fixes.
>The fixes you make to the application should meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria. For example, the app should be keyboard accessible and provide a good screen reader experience.

Regarding WCAG:

>If at any point you are confused about a guideline, search for related content on the web or ask in digital accessibility communities such as the [WebAIM mailing list](https://webaim.org/discussion/). The official [“Understanding”](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) and [“How to Meet”](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) documents are also useful for providing an additional context where success criteria are a bit vague.

I've tried to summarize the workflow that Marcy suggests and you can find it in the [workflow-template.md file](./workflow-template.md)

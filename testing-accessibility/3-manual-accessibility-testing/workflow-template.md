# Workflow template for manual accessibility testing 

## Background from course module intro
> The next time you need to test a web application, create a document and follow these steps as a starting point. Include additional notes, screenshots, and links to resources along the way.
>Whether youâ€™re responsible for mitigating issues or not, the test report you compile will help you prioritize fixes and ship a more accessible application.

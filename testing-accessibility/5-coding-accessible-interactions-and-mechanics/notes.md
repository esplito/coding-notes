## Section 1 - Intro & overview

>For accessibility, itâ€™s worth pointing out that JavaScript is necessary for things like responding to events and setting ARIA attributes that can track state.
>
>In this workshop, weâ€™re going to focus on a lot of JavaScript. But remember, it layers on top of the basics of semantic HTML and well-styled CSS. - Marcy
## Section 2 - The Keyboard

>In this section, weâ€™ll revisit keyboard accessibility in the CampSpots application and examine techniques for improving the keyboard userâ€™s experience on the web. - Marcy
### Lesson 1 - Identifying Keyboard Operability Issues

>ðŸ’¡Tip: As an exercise, change the focus outline CSS to a color that provides an accessible contrast ratio against the search button.

>**In this section, weâ€™ll dive deeper into patterns, conventions, and techniques of how to make things respond to the keyboard.**

>ðŸ’¡Tip: Other elements that are focusable by default include form inputs and links with href attributes.

>ðŸ’¡Tip: When building a more involved interaction like the date picker, itâ€™s valuable to do some testing with people who rely on the keyboard. Their feedback helps make sure youâ€™re providing a good experience without making assumptions.

### Lesson 2 - Resources for Keyboard-Focused Development

Useful resources to help us test and implement keyboard-friendly web applications:
- [No Mouse Days Package](https://github.com/marcysutton/no-mouse-days)
	- "The idea is to have a package you can install that turns off the mouse cursor in your application one day a week." - Marcy
	- Alternative: Run the following in your console on the page you like to test:
	  `document.body.style.cursor = "none"`
- [The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
	- "Whenever youâ€™re building a web application, itâ€™s helpful to follow patterns." - Marcy
	- "... a wealth of information about the conventions behind the most common controls used in web development. Each of the patterns they outline include a description of expected keyboard interactions." - Marcy
	- When building custom components compare it to [the list of patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
		- ðŸš¨ It is not production-ready patterns. You have to test them too! ðŸš¨

### Lesson 3 - CSS Visibility Techniques in the CampSpots Component Sandbox

Small examples of common components that we can use for experimentation can be found at `http://localhost:1234/component-sandbox` when running the project locally.

>When we apply different CSS visibility techniques to the button, we can look at how the Accessibility Tree changes.
>
>Itâ€™s a useful tool for troubleshooting issues that might be caused by a parent element further up the tree. - Marcy

**Techniques covered in the lesson**:
- "visually-hidden" class (the class we have used previously in other workshops to hide content visually but still make it available in the accessibility tree)
  
- "opacity"
	- apply `opacity: 0;` in CSS
	- we don't see the element but it still rendered and you'll get a tab stop at the element.
	  
- "display"
	- apply `display: none;` in CSS
	- "... a big hammer that hides the element from everybody in every context." - Marcy
	- "One interesting fact is that you can still use `aria-labelledby` to reference an element with `display: none;` applied to it."  - Marcy
	  
- "visibility"
	- apply `visibility: hidden;` in CSS
	- "This is a good technique if you donâ€™t want something affect your layout but itâ€™s irrelevant for a screen reader to read aloud." - Marcy
	  
- "aria-hidden"
	- Isn't a CSS approach
	- "If a screen reader is able to focus on a tab stop that doesnâ€™t have accessibility information, it can cause what is known as a _ghost control_. It can be quite confusing! Chrome has evolved in this scenario, where the element is `aria-hidden` but still focusable, to render it with accessibility information anyway." - Marcy
	- apply `aria-hidden="true"` and `tabindex="-1"` to element in HTML
		- "On its own, `aria-hidden="true"` affects screen readers and not the keyboard." - Marcy
#### Debugging Visibility Issues

>If you find yourself in a situation where you canâ€™t see where you are on the page or you canâ€™t operate a control, check out the CSS in DevTools

>Because of the _box of spiders_ that the `focus` pseudo-selector implementation has been historically for mouse users, a new `focus-visible` pseudo-selector was created for keyboard users. Focus-visible uses heuristics to apply focus styles more intelligently for keyboard interactions where focus couldnâ€™t be updated or adapted. 

Do the following in Chrome's CSS pane (in DevTools):
>Click the `:hov` option, then select `:focus` and `:focus-visible` to force the element to be activated for both scenarios. 

### Lesson 4 - Implement a Skip Link Component

>When a keyboard user navigates, they will have to Tab through the menu in order to move down to the main content of the page. Of course, this isnâ€™t as bad as having to Tab through all of the non-visible menu items like we saw previously but it still doesnâ€™t provide a great experience.
>
>Skip links to the rescue!
>
>Not only are skip links useful for keyboard access, they are also a requirement in [WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.1, Bypass Blocks (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bypass-blocks).

Common usage:
- "Skip to main content" to get past repeated navigation

Occasional usage:
- "Back to top" on a long page

Other useful areas:
- Non-modal dialogs
- or other places where it would be nice to be able to jump around the page with a keyboard

A **skip link can**:
- Point to an ID attribute on a container element
	- Example: `<a href="#main">`Â ->Â `<main id="main">`

A **skip link should**:
- Be visible to all keyboard users
	- and **not be visually-hidden for screen reader use only** (this was common previously)

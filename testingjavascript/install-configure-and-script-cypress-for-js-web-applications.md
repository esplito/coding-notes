## What's changed in Install, Configure, and Script Cypress for JavaScript Web Applications

- Kent updated some packages
- Most significant changes are in `@testing-library/cypress`

1. You no longer need to do chaining of `.findByText().click().findByText().click()...`
2. You no long need to use `queryBy` when asserting if an element is not in the DOM. You can use `findBy`! 🥳
